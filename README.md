# Textbox

Textbox is a simple app I'm building to practice my web development skills.\
Think of it as a toolbox to reach for when working with text, lists, and other data.\
Each tool should be concise, with enough options to be useful and flexible without being overwhelming.

My plan is to update this app with new tools over time, as I think of useful tools that will provide a fun challenge and keep my skills sharp.
